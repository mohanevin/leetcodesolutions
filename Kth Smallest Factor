Kth Smallest Factor

GIven two positive integers N and K. You have to find the Kth smallest factor of N. A factor of N is a positive integer which divides N. Output the Kth smallest factor of N if it exists otherwise print -1.

 

Example 1:

Input : N = 4 , K = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
All factors of 4 are 1,2 and 4. Out of
these 2 is the 2nd smallest.
Example 2:

Input : N = 4 , K = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:
All factors of 4 are 1,2 and 4. Out of
these 4 is the 3rd smallest.

solution:

 Solution {
  public:
    int kThSmallestFactor(int N , int K) {
        // code here
        int i=1,c=0;
        while(i<=N)
        {
            if(N%i==0)
            {
                c++;
            }
            if(c==K)
            {
                return i;
            }
            i++;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
